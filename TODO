- The session list in landscape mode should put the timestamp
  to the right of the session label rather than the bottom,
  to conserve space. However, due to a bug in Android that is

  "res/layout-land/session_list_item.xml" for more information.
- "Clear current input" option on game screen to clear out all
  score edits and quickly begin new.

  and offer them through a context menu.
- Add an about menu with version information.
- Do not jump to submit button if it is disabled (e.g. all 
  fields empty).
