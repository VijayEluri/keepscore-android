- Floats: Currently, only integer values are supported.

- The session list in landscape mode should put the timestamp
  to the right of the session label rather than the bottom,
  to conserve space. However, due to a bug in Android that is
  not quite as simple as it should be. See the comment in
  "res/layout-land/session_list_item.xml" for more information.

- Add an about menu with version information.

- Custom labels for the sessions (Nicolas Gramlich on SlideME).

- Toggle table view to show the direct scores for each round
  rather than the current sum (Nicolas Gramlich on SlideME).

- To make the app more generic and usable for a greater variety
  of games, add options to:

    - Not disable the last players edit field, e.g. allow
      unbalanced rounds.

    - Not automatically provide default values for the other
      players, but rather default them to 0 (so the user can
      add a new round by simply entering the scores for those
      players who's scores need changing).

      Allowing 0-rounds probably is also a good idea, there
      might be games where this makes sense.

    - Not fill an edit with the value of the last edit field
      when entering. For some games, this might make things
      more complicated.

  All those options should be per-session, so that different
  games can use different settings. There should also be
  default settings, so that players who always play a specific
  game who's requirementsdo not match the system defaults do
  not have to change them on every new game.

- Improve input options:

    - Swiping an edit field horizontally  could change the
      sign (i.e. *-1)

    - Double tapping could clear a field.

    - "Clear current input" option on game screen to clear out all
      score edits and quickly begin new. This could also be
      implemented using a gesture.

    - Remember the X previously used or most commonly used scores
      and offer them through a context menu. Possible even better
      would be a dropdown.

 - Remember X previously used player names and offer them through a
   context menu or dropdown.

- An help screen is needed to explain the above options.

- Add a confirmation query for "Delete game".

- Add a "start game" item to the menu, some people have trouble
  noticing the button behaviour change.
